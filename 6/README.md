### Code structure
The jupyter notebook has cells for setup and each plot. To run them, start up the notebook (using Jupyter or any other tool), and execute every cell to get the outputs. 
### Libraries
The libraries required are 
- ```random```
- ```matplotlib```

Each of these libraries can be installed by simply running ```pip3 install <library-name>```.
