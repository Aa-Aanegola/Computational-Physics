# Computational-Physics
Each directory contains a python notebook with the code for the particular task, a report with important findings and a README for setup information. 
This repository contains the code for the following:
- Random walks
- Monte Carlo estimation
- Phase space trajectory of a harmonic oscillator
- Numerical solution of the 1D diffusion equation
- Potential energy of a configuration of water molecules
- Monte Carlo integration
- Ising (1D spin) model
- Predator-prey model
- Potential energy of a configuration, Hessian calculation and vibrational frequency histogram
